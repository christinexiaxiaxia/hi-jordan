	        <p>// 42 min 9 sec video, 5 × 7 in book, interactive installation (oscilloscope, microphone, script).</p>

	        <p><i>Thank you for reminding me</i> is an ongoing project that creates new connections with our surrounding spaces by embracing the mistranslation of old ideas. Rather than taking a flawed approach to adapting valuable yet somewhat outdated writings and beliefs from the past, this work attempts to find beauty in the bits and pieces that are lost in translation while still acknowledging both the past and present. This project will continually iterate by pairing new texts with new locations, resulting in a growing number of documented performances/scenes that hold unique connections with their respective spaces.</p>

	        <p>The work is composed of three parts: a video documentation of the on-location performance, a book made from the logged speech-to-text of said performance, and an interactive installation of the oscilloscope and a script of the selected piece of writing.</p>

	        <p>The first scene is called <i>We have only just met</i> and was based on translating the introductory chapter of Lauren Elkin’s <i>Flâneuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Venice, and London</i>. While personally I find gaps within and disagree with her writing approach in some places, she vocalizes an importance in not forgetting about the <i>flâneur</i> by trying to find a place for the role in today’s urban landscape; outside of its original definition for the bourgeois French man.</p>

	        <p id="no-bottom-margin">Using the old technology of an oscilloscope, the more contemporary tech development of Google’s <i>Cloud Speech-to-Text</i>, and my own flawed reading of the chapter, I set myself in the alleys hidden within Toronto for my performance. The text generated from my reading was then taken to create a 183-page book of Elkin’s original 21-page chapter.</p>

	        <p id="no-bottom-margin">Swooshes, ink traps, and alternate glyphs galore, <i>Defunkt</i> is a new typeface that carries on the tradition of weird and awkward grotesques. This is an avenue that has absolutely already been explored, but why not keep having fun? <i>Defunkt</i> seeks to inherit the conventions that define its predecessors but implements glyphs with high-contrast and dramatic strokes. With display use as their goal, characters slope in and out with gusto to produce unusual and energetic forms. Where strokes are often thin, they are thick; where they are usually wide and strong, forms are pinched and narrow; letterforms shrink, grow, and confidently flare out.</p>

	        <p class="works header">Essentially Anonymous<!-- , <span class="works date">2020</span> --></p>

	        <p>// Pair of 5 × 7 in hardcover books.</p>

	        <p><i>Essentially Anonymous</i> is a two-part installation comprised of two books, one that can touched and flipped through and another that is out-of-reach and unknowable. Both books are comprised of expedition photographs collected from the American Museum of Natural History’s digital archives; the untouchable book in the corner is filled with nameless photographs of people taken by researchers during these expeditions while the in-reach book puts the faces of said researchers on display for viewers to examine. These images are interspersed with a poem addressing the conflicts within the act of speaking for others and documenting experiences outside of your own. This work is a part of my undergraduate capstone project to be completed in May 2020 that addresses the issue of disinterring history and speaking about the pain of others.</p>

	        <p>The untouchable book rests above the viewer’s head, with its pages almost out of sight, positioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_corner" target="_blank"><i>icon corner</i></a> to pay a modest tribute to these anonymous individuals by transforming the book they reside in into a type of worship space or alter. Instead of their anonymity taking away from their individuality, this type of anonymity removes these people’s faces and bodies from display altogether and returns the control of visibility back to these individuals. In contrast, the book that viewers are able to touch and see is filled with images of the expeditioners, the ones that have performed questionable acts of documentation. Both books are nearly identical: same number of pages, same text, same size. The only difference is the portraits that have been swapped out. With antiquated and unethical anthropological research practices often putting the most vulnerable people on display, this pair of books does the opposite by putting the perpetrators on display.</p>

	        <p class="works">Below is the poem that is woven between the portraits within each book:</p>

	        <p class="works header">Monday Night Seminars + Rave in Berlin 1100<!-- , <span class="works date">2019</span> --></p>

	        <p>// Single-page website + web-based typeface.</p>

	        <p class="works">This site is a web-poster made to promote a possible series of events for <i>Monday Night Seminars</i> presented by the McLuhan Centre of Culture and Technology. With the series being inspired by McLuhan’s <i>The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man</i>, the idea of an ‘industrialized folklore’ seeped into the the composition, selected typefaces, choice of colour, and user interaction. Rather than this “folklore” being based in distant stories from the past, the types of cultural narratives McLuhan addresses in his essays looks to technology and the popular culture that has grown around it.</p>

	        <p class="works">Leaning into this modern folklore theme, a composition with heavy typographic ornamentation, a web-based display face, another calligraphic typeface, a modern re-cut of Times New Roman, and a more “digitized” book reading experience with the use of stick elements that you flip/scroll through. The chaotic interactions are meant to make the users hyperaware of their engagement with the large amounts of content they are presented with, reflecting the arguments in <i>The Mechanical Bride</i>. This leads back into the seminars which all address different ways in which we can begin to tackle, disassemble, and take control over the overwhelming and over-growing techno-culture that surrounds us.</p>

	        <p><i>Rave in Berlin 1100</i> is a display face created purely with HTML and CSS. While its rigid set of rules and alignments keep it in a strict blackletter-esque order, its pointed curves sweep above and below the cap-heights and baselines to form a systematically dramatic set of glyphs.</p>
